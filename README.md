# GoHugo Component / Head

This is a GoHugo theme component that solves the old question "What tags belong into the `<head>` tag of my website?" Set it up, configure it, forget it's there. This component adds a multitude of tags and is extensively configurable.

If you want to independently of this module learn about all that is possible in the `<head>` tag then have a look at [htmlhead.dev](https://htmlhead.dev/)

Read more about it [in the documentation](https://kollitsch.dev/components/hugo-head/).
